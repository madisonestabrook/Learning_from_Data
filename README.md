# Learning_from_Data
This repo contains my files as I work my way through the [Learning from Data MOOC at CalTech](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html). The programing language that I am using is [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Whenever possible, I am using _base Julia_ (meaning no third-party packages). The version of Julia that I am using is 1.5.2.

## Why Julia?
Some may be thinking "Why *not* Python?" While I am quite familiar with Python (3.X), I wanted to challenge myself by learning a different language. I chose Julia because it solves the two-language problem.
